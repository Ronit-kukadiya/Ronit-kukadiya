- ⚡ Fun fact: There is a black hole called Phoenix A, and it is estimated to be 100 billion times the mass of our Sun, comparable to the mass of an entire galaxy.
                Its event horizon is 590 billion kilometers wide,or more than 100 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto, or about 1/16 of a lightyear wide.
                To get a visualization of how big that is on a human scale, lets shrink our solar system by 1 trillion times.
                The Sun would be 1 millimeter wide, and Pluto would be a little more than 5 meters away,
                and that black hole would be 590 meters wide. For reference, Alpha Centauri would be about 40 kilometers away at that scale.
